# Theatre play and Actor: TheAItre, Scene 6
When I was preparing for my presentation on Capek's play _R.U.R._ I came across a play writtecn completely by an AI - the project celebrated the 100th anniversary of the original Capek's publication, which introduced the word robot to the world. Due to its element of absurdity, I chose the sixth scene of the TheAItre play titled "Burn Out". In this scene, robot sits at psychologistâ€™s office, because he feels like his existence has no meaning.

## How would you build the actor?
Since the actor is sitting throughout the whole scene, I would probably disregard its locomotion and I would focus on other forms of expression. 
The actor needs to communicate and express a sense of being lost, hopeless, stressed and burnt out. I want my robot to have a head and a face (not necessarily humanoid looking), which will move and trigger in reaction to the therapist's comments, communicating the above-mentioned set of negative emotions. 

## What technical features will the actor need?
I think the combined usage of Neopixel, servos and LEDs can potentially work together in expressing these nuanced emotions, as well as carry a slightly heavier conversation that is taking place in the therapy session. 

## How will you construct the actor to create the role?
A necessary part to be included is setting the scene in a psychologist's office environment - and the act of the robot actor sitting in a chair, facing the psychologist. A chair is therefore crucial, and its construction can even become part of the robot itself. 

## How will you decorate or dress the actor for best effect?
I am not sure whether dressing the actor is necessary, since the character in the play is a robot too - and has no specified appearance in the character description. This gives me a lot of creative freedom and flexibility to design and build anything I consider relevant and approapriate for the robot in the scene. However, I will consider the costume as the project goes on, as it might help with communicating the negative emotions. 

## What sequence of moves or other actions will you give your actor so that they can best play the part?
I am not intending to use any locomotion, since the passive (yet eflective) act of sitting is crucial for the scene. However, movement sequences of servo could be used for turning the head (at slower speed, using sharp movements). The Neopixel sequence could utilize the brightness function, which would increase and decrease (to symbolise the hopelessness) and change colors in response to the psychologist's comments.
