# Theatre play and Actor: TheAItre, Scene 6
When I was preparing for my presentation on Capek's play _R.U.R._, I came across a play written completely by an AI - the project celebrated the 100th anniversary of the original Capek's publication, which introduced the word robot to the world. Due to its element of absurdity, I chose the sixth scene of the TheAItre play titled "Burn Out". In this scene, robot sits at psychologistâ€™s office, because he feels like his existence has no meaning.

## How would you build the actor?
Since the actor is sitting throughout the whole scene, I would probably disregard its locomotion and I would focus on other forms of expression. 
The actor needs to communicate and express a sense of being lost, hopeless, stressed and burnt out. I want my robot to have a head, face and arms (not necessarily humanoid looking), which will move and trigger in reaction to the therapist's comments, communicating the above-mentioned set of negative emotions. 

## What technical features will the actor need?
I think the combined usage of Neopixel, and LEDs will work for the robot's face, while servos can be used for the robot's neck and arms. These can potentially all work together in expressing the nuanced emotions of stress and burn out, as well as carry reactions to a slightly heavier conversation that is taking place in the therapy session between the psychologist and the robot. 

## How will you construct the actor to create the role?
A necessary part to be included  in the scebe is setting it in a psychologist's office environment - and the act of the robot actor sitting in a chair, facing the psychologist. A chair is therefore crucial, and its construction can even become part of the robot itself. 

## How will you decorate or dress the actor for best effect?
I am not sure whether dressing the actor is necessary, since the character in the play is a robot too - and has no specified appearance in the character description. This gives me a lot of creative freedom and flexibility to design and build anything I consider relevant and approapriate for the robot in the scene. However, I will consider the costume as the project goes on, as it might eventually help with communicating the negative emotions. 

## What sequence of moves or other actions will you give your actor so that they can best play the part?
I am not intending to use any locomotion, since the passive (yet reflective) act of sitting is crucial for the scene. However, movement sequences of servo could be used for turning the head, arms and neck (at slower speed, using sharp movements). The Neopixel sequence could utilize the brightness function on the robot's face, which would increase and decrease (to symbolise the hopelessness) and change colors in response to the psychologist's comments.
