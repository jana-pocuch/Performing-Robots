# Theatre play and Actor 
Choose a short scene from a play and a character in that scene, and consider how you would make a robot actor to perform that scene. Any spoken words will come from a human or a computer, not from your actor.

When I was preparing for my presentation on Capek's play _R.U.R._ I came across a play writtecn completely by an AI - the project celebrated the 100th anniversary of the original Capek's publication, which introduced the word robot to the world. Due to its element of absurdity, I chose the sixth scene of the TheAItre play titled "Burn Out". In this scene, robot sits at psychologistâ€™s office, because he feels like his existence has no meaning.

## How would you build the actor?
Since the actor is sitting throughout the whole scene, I would probably disregard its locomotion and I would focus on other forms of expression. 
The actor needs to communicate and express a sense of being lost, hopeless and stressed. 

## What technical features will the actor need?
I think the combined usage of Neopixel, servos and LEDs can potentially work together in expressing the nuanced emotions, as well as carry a slightly heavier conversation that is taking place in the therapy session. 

## How will you construct the actor to create the role?
A necessary part to be included is the psychologist's office set up - and the act or the robot actor sitting in a chair. A chair is therefore crucial, and its construction will even become part of the robot itself. 

## How will you decorate or dress the actor for best effect?
I am not sure whether dressing the actor is necessary, since the character in the play is a robot too - and has no specified appearance. This gives me a lot of creative freedom and flexibility to design and build anything I consider relevant and approapriate for the robot in the scene. 

## What sequence of moves or other actions will you give your actor so that they can best play the part?
I am not intending to use any locomotion, since the act of sitting is crucial for the scene. However,
