# Theatre play and Actor 
Choose a short scene from a play and a character in that scene, and consider how you would make a robot actor to perform that scene. Any spoken words will come from a human or a computer, not from your actor.

When I was preparing for my presentation on Capek's play _R.U.R._ I came across a play writtecn completely by an AI - the project celebrated the 100th anniversary of the original Capek's publication, which introduced the word robot to the world. Due to its element of absurdity, I chose the sixth scene of the TheAItre play titled "Burn Out". In this scene, robot sits at psychologistâ€™s office, because he feels like his existence has no meaning.

## How would you build the actor?

Since the actor is sitting throughout the while scene, I would probably disregard locomotion and I would focus on other forms of expression. 

## What technical features will the actor need?


## How will you construct the actor to create the role?

## How will you decorate or dress the actor for best effect?

## What sequence of moves or other actions will you give your actor so that they can best play the part?
