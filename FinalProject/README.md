## Script Outline
### Scene 2
Grumpy should be moving in a fast and sharp manner, frantically going around. Frantic arm gestures should also be included (arms would be preferrably controlled by potentiometers). The neopixel sequence would also be alternating between indifferent and very grumpy (probably two states - simple animation). Grumpy would potentially be one of the first dwarfs leading them home in a line, as he cannot wait to be alone and out of work. 

### Scene 3
Grumpy is just staring at Snow white (DC motors not moving) and then angrily throwing its hands around (with the neopixel sequnce being static on the "very grumpy" state. 

### Scene 5 (Snow White falls asleep because of the bug) 
Grumpy's arms lower, his neopixel state goes to "indifferent". He slowly moves around Snow White in confusion.

# AND JUST LIKE THAT, DOPEY IT IS
Due to some shceduling conflicts, me and Katie had to split up and work on separate dwarfs. The remaining one was Dopey (so I resurrected him after he got deleted from the script), and even though that I got a bit behind, I started designing him. 
Since I will have only one controller available, the functionality will be a little limited and simplistic.
