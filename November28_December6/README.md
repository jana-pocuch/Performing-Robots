# The Freudian Robot 

I was a bit skeptical when I first saw the title of the reading. Even though that Freud really made his name known in the field of psychology, at this time, his theories belong more into history books. However, the Freudian terminology provided a useful framework in the end to discuss the human-machine relationship.

The idea that was the most intriguing to me was the friction between human-machine relationship being purely (1) prosthetic and instrumental, or (2) offering an interactive and transformative view. However, are they really opposing each other? Can this relationship have both qualities simultaneously, or even transcend these categories? 

And of course, after discussing the human-machine relationship, the question of hierarchy must pop up. In other words, as the author poses: "do human beings become masters of their machines, or their slaves"? This question particularly struck me in relation to another argument the author mentions: that the physiological deficiencies of humans "are in need of prosthetic extensions through technology", towards which humans develop increasing attachment. It immediately made me think of cellphones, which became a prosthetic extension we carry everywhere, and without which we cannot imagine our lives. They help us not only with our physiological deficiencies, but also mental/psychological ones. With a phone at your hand, you are, in a way, and enhanced, more capable version of a human being. However, to a very addictive extent. However, to tackle Liu's question: are we masters or slaves of our phones? Even though that I'm leaning towards answering that we are "slaves", it is us, humans, that enslaved us to this technology. Instead of just focusing on covering and helping our human blinds spots, phone and the applications on it are also designed to target your weaknesses, mostly connected to our attention. All in order to make us spend as much time in the application as possible.

In this case, the technology is not the villain that enslaves us - it just does what we tell it to do. The question of a master and slave gets a lot more complex.

And here are some other questions that popped up when reading the text: 
- What is "an intelligent automaton"? How do we define intelligence in this case? 
- What role does gender play in creating automatons/robots? What does gender assigned to technology say about human psychological, physiological and political contexts? 
- Is "the good of technology" really only in saving labor/improving efficiency? What about entertainment? Societal critique? Art creation?
