# Snow White Play

Regardless of whether we end up doing more shorter scenes or one long one, I think that the scene where the dwarfs discover Snow White in one of their beds should be included (if not the central scene). 

There is a lot of potential: Snow White (Spot) would go try the beds and eventually fall asleep in one of them. Then the robot dwarfs would come home, shocked to find Snow White - surround her bed until she wakes up. They would introduce each other- every robot would get a spotlight, performing an action related to their name, and eventually SnoW White would also explain her story and how she needs help.
