# Digital Theatre by Nadja Masura - Chapter 6 "The ‘Other’ Actor"

My first observation (or more accurately, a frustration) is that a book format does not do a good service to such theatre commentaries. 
I really struggled with understanding the points that the author wanted to demonstrate, since only a brief description of production examples was provided. It seems even counter intuitive to be discussing theatre and how it experiments with deploying technology with the use of text only, with no interaction, too few images, and no videos. 

Yet, in terms of content, my favourite idea in the chapter was one that also keeps recurring in our class dicusssion: which is the idea of robots in theatre as a playground for exploring future scenarious of human-robot interaction in the real world. In other words, while we are not in a stage, where robots would play a substantial part in our everyday lives, we can imagine such futures (and maybe prepare for it/work towards it) thanks to theatre and robot actors. However, the new layer to this idea that made me stop and think was that the robots on stage are always put in a contrast to humans and vice versa. Why is this? Are we trying to learn more about ourselves or about the robots through this juxtaposition? 

The author proposes that if we are able to "see ourselves in relation to the other" then "we can come to new understandings of human nature and the urge to create and control". It sounds like we tend to make everything about us, humans.  

What would, however, happen if we put these two actors (robot and human) on a stage, but not as each other's opposites, but as equals? Why do we struggle so much to imagine and explore scenarios, in which we would accept the robots "walking around with us"?
