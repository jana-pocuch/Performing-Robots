# On Stage: Robots as performer

I really appreciated Hoffman's categorization of robot performers into (1) fully scripted, (2) extremely simple, and (3) fully teleoperated robots. I think I was aware of these differences, but only after these clear-cut definitions, I was able to see the real challenge: which is the issue of incorporating intuitive responsiveness of the robots. 
Up until now, the two performances of the robots I created were fully scripted, with some elements of teleoperation of the robots by me. However, in both these instances, as the article made me realize, the robots were not "truly" acting. They were just executing the job I assigned them, just doing what the code told them to do. They were not capable of doing anything else. There was not Stanislawski method deployed in their performance, nor were they getting in an out of a role, nor they were reacting to other performers. 

My biggest question that came out of reading this: Can we even build a true robot actor? A robot that would be conscious of the fact they are playing and performing? And, alternatively, conscious of when they are NOT playing of performing? Robots that could be able to adapt to many different roles (not just one they were scripted for)?

What is more hould we always be looking at robots in theatre as "testbeds" and testing grounds for the possibilities of human-robot-interaction? Doesn't it limit the creative potential of the play and performers too, if thery are always under the pressure to be testing a real-life possibility? 

# Play suggestion 
Way back in fall 2019, I was taking a class with professor Wateman, which was called Contagion (ironically enough, during the course of the class, first cases of COVID-19 started appearing). One the pieces that stuck with me was a play _Angels in America_ by Tony Kushner. The plot is set in 1980's, right when the AIDS epidemic started to spread in the United States, and was mostly affecting homosexual men. Therefore, the key theme of the play is the stigma around homosexuality and how the state did almost nothing to fight or address the issue. 

Nowadays, we do not need to
