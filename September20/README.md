# First Robot (yay)

## What is a Robot? 
My first tendency when trying to define the word was to go into the direction of the robot doing something **for a human**. This something could range from entertainment, help, joy, simplifying some mundane tasks, to fully performing a certain task for (and isntead of) the human. Either way, in my mind at first, a robot was a machine that has its purpose (and its program to fulfilli that purpose), that is formed and executed only in raltion to humans, their needs and concerning some aspect of their life. 
Therefore, I wanted to first build a robot that would hand an object over to a human, an audience member. Yet, I realized that this is strictly functional and that the theatre aspect could potentially free the robot from purpose and demands of the human, and perform just for itself. 


## Process and Difficulties
As mentioned, my original intentions were quite different. I wanted to created a little humanoid cart, which, despite some struggle and bumps on the road, would bring a flower to the audience memeber who would be watching. Through this it would have fulfilled its purpose and would have come back to its place until it can give another flower to another audience member. 

But I struggled INCREDIBLY making this work from the technical standpoint. As you can see on the picture, I tried to put together an extremely simple cart but I just could not get the material I had to cooperate and reliably stick together. So I played with the material for a bit, then with the code, then again with the material, hoping it would somehow click or started working. But it didn't. The amount of glue I wasted here is pitiful, and I wish there was at least some nice learning curve to it. At this point it does not feel that way exactly.

So in the __second attempt__ I brainstormed the idea from scratch and realized that my initial definition of a robot as an enhancement of and help to humans might not be applicable universally. And as I was playing around with different gadgets and materials I tried to distance myself both from creating something humanoid and something that serves humans only. I put together servos, toilet paper rolls cut into small pieces, plastic bottle caps, cardboard and some paper and plastic waste to build two flower-like structures that will mutually communicate through movemement.

And here is an initial second attempt/brainstorm:

And here is the final result:

They needed quite a bit of tweaking when it came to weight distribution, as well as with balance. But there is nothing cardboard and glue couldn't fix, or, as seen on the picture, a little cut in the plastic, so that the wires are comfortly placed there.

  ## The Story
The point of the story is that two flowers are having a conversation that is incomprehensible for humans. The flowers are having the conversation for them and them only. It does not serve a purpose to solely serve humans. The human is supposed to be an observer. What we as humans can only detect from the conversation is that the taller flower in the pot is moving slowly, with more difficulty, while the smaller one in the plastic dome moves more energetically, faster and with more enthusiasm. It seems like the taller one is expressing some hesitation, reservation or worry, while the smaller is more impatient and lively. They, however, have a respectful exchange, waiting for whatever the other has to say to finish before speaking. But the actual content? We will never know. We just observe and their conversation does not serve us - it primarily serves them.

## Findings
The main realization I had in this process was that I struggle to envision things from scratch and linearly execute things from idea to finish. I seem to need a lot more "messing around" with the material and code in order to get inspired and settle on an idea (which can be frustrating and time consuming). Also, I really need to work on improving my skills when it comes to building something with motors, as this practically held me back 

However, the main realization was that my definition of a robot developed, or even changed throughout the process. I let go of the idea of serving to human experience, and instead focused on the "beauty" within the specialization I programmed for the robot.
