# First Robot (yay)

## What is a Robot? 
My first tendency when trying to define the word was to go into the direction of the robot doing something **for a human**. This something could range from entertainment, help, joy, simplifying some mundane tasks, to fully performing a certain task for (and isntead of) the human. Either way, in my mind at first, a robot was a machine that has its purpose (and its program to fulfilli that purpose), that is formed and executed only in raltion to humans, their needs and concerning some aspect of their life. 
Therefore, I wanted to first build a robot that would hand an object over to a human, an audience member. Yet, I realized that this is strictly functional and that the theatre aspect could potentially free the robot from purpose and demands of the human, and perform just for itself. 


## Process and Difficulties
As mentioned, my original intentions were quite different. I wanted to created a little humanoid cart, which, despite some struggle and bumps on the road, would bring a flower to the audience memeber who would be watching. Through this it would have fulfilled its purpose and would have come back to its place until it can give another flower to another audience member. 

But I struggled INCREDIBLY making this work from the technical standpoint. As you can see on the picture, I tried to put together an extremely simple cart but I just could not get the material I had to cooperate and reliably stick together. So I played with the material for a bit, then with the code, then again with the material, hoping it would somehow click or started working. But it didn't. The amount of glue I wasted here is pitiful, and I wish there was at least some nice learning curve to it. At this point it does not feel that way exactly.

<p> So in the **second attempt** I brainstormed the idea from scratch and realized that my initial definition of a robot as enhancement and help to humans might not be strictly applicable universally. And as I was playing around with different gadgets </p>
